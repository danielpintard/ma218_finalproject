This project was for my final as apart of my MA218 - Probability and Statistics course. I was to come up with a hypothesis and find a dataset and 
to conduct statistical test(s) to come to a conclusion regarding the hypothesis. As for this project, after reviewing literature, I hypothesized 
that the proportion of nosocomial infections (healthcare-associated infections) that were a result of the patient being infected with Methicillin-resistant 
*Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) was 0.31 (i.e. 31 out of 100 nosocomial infections are the result of MRSA). The prevalence and incidence of
MRSA in hostpitals has been a cause for concern in the medical field considering that these particular strains of *S. aureus* (bacterial species 
which is the etiological/causitive agent of staph infection) are resistant to the only antibiotic that would be germicidal for them (i.e. methinicillin).
The null hypothesis, as aforementioned, was p = 0.31.
The alternative hypothesis was that p > 0.31, making this a right-tailed test and requiring a 1-proportion z-test to test against the signifigance level of
Î± = 0.05. 

I chose to turn to programming as a means of completion for this project to display my abilities with the Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib libraries in 
python. Ever since recieveing my [Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/danielpintard/data-analysis-with-python-v7) from freeCodeCamp
I have not had the opporotunity to apply my data analysis skills to a project, so I thought that this particular project was the perfect opportunity to brush
up on my data analysis skills with Python. Also, given that I have finally taken a course in Statistics, I felt it would be more than appropriate to conjoin my newly acquired knowledge of statistics with the data analysis and programming skills I already possess.
